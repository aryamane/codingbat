  ## The above can be shortened to:
  ##   return ((a_smile and b_smile) or (not a_smile and not b_smile))
  ## Or this very short version (think about how this is the same as the above)
  ##   return (a_smile == b_smile)



# We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters a_smile and b_smile indicate if each is smiling. 
# We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Return True if we are in trouble.
